# 🧠 PyQVault — Smart PYQ Management & OCR Analyzer

PyQVault is an intelligent **Previous Year Question (PYQ) Management System** built with **Streamlit** and **OCR-powered text extraction**.  
It allows users to **upload, search, and analyze** question papers by automatically extracting text from PDFs and images — making topic discovery faster than ever!

  - Automatically stores both the file and its extracted text.
  ```

### 🔍 Smart Search
- Search by **subject, semester, year, university, course code**, or **tags**.
- Built-in **keyword/sentence frequency search** inside extracted text.
- Instantly find **how many times a topic or question appears** across multiple PYQs.

### 📂 Organized Management
- All uploads are timestamped and stored in a clean folder structure.

   5️⃣  The app shows how many times that word/sentence appears across all uploaded question papers
   ```
